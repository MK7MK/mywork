ABSTRACT:-
The Moviepedia is two way responsive web page which will be responsible for show output to user he or she wants and will get input from a user he or she give. It also allow user to login which will get username and password from user and also allows user to get in as guest user.  But while entering as guest he or she may not give her input (i.e cannot give imdb rating). So once user can logged and search for movie, awards, cast, etc...  that his or her wants.

OBJECTIVE:-
This website is a basic idea of responsive web design which will be very useful for movie lovers (filmophile).  Those who are interested in details about a movie or about the director.  Also people who are in making projects especially final year film college students of field film studies.  

DELIVERABLES(FEATURES):-
1. User login/sign up authentication or guest.
2. Imdb rating functionality

4. films and awards section 
5. personal details information for logged users

TOOLS:-
 OPERATING SYSTEM:-
 • Microsoft Windows 

FRONTEND :-
• Html 
• Css 
• Javascript
 These tools will be used to create for the frontend design of the web application.

BACKEND :-
• DATABASE: mangodb
• Framework
• Nodejs
These tools can be used to create a server-side interface which will make the input validated by the user is stored and the objective behind the input is fulfilled.

STAKEHOLDERS:-
The system would be used by following people:-

External stakeholder:-
A)	Direct users
1. movie enthusiasts
2. youtubers, video editors, Bloggers
	B)   Secondary Users
		1. Streaming Outlets
		2. Reviewers

Internal Stakeholders:-
	Developers

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS:-
The following requirement detail the major functions that the system must perform.
REQ-1: The user must be able to login/signup using his/her email password o authenticated using his/her google/ facebook account.
REQ-2: The user should be able to perform the functionalities entailed by the application.  The user can preview the details of any Movie and perform the rating and review function.  Updation of the movie rating when the user gives imdb rating.
REQ-3: The system keeps track of the movie details in its database and should be updated when the admin adds an item or removes it.
REQ-4: The search mechanism yields a negative result, when an item is not present in the database and provides the item if it present.  The search mechanism should be user interactive by having a auto-complete feature.

MODULE DESCRIPTION:-
Module-1:-
This module contains with the landing page for our web application.  It will include a login/signup option for the user with a user authentication.
Module-2: -

PROCESS MODEL: 
The process model we plan to use for this project is Agile Model. Since our web application is user friendly and feature-driven we plan to follow the EXtreme programming method under Agile.  
XP allows for a test-driven development which is the most suitable for us as we need to run our modules through multiple iterations of tests to check for its correctness. 
This method allows us to do pair programming which will be beneficial for our team since we are a team of 3 members and each one can take the responsibility for a pair of modules which will ensure that each module is well built and debugged. 
This method also allows for continuous integration of codes written by the developers and this feature of XP allows us to integrate the model and test it iteratively.  This will help us in adding smaller features like auto-complete/voice enabled search as continuous integration allows for easy adding of new features.
